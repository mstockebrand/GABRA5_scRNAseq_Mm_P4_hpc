#  Cell Type Assignment
Cell type assignment was based on cluster-specific expression of molecular markers, according to Barkas et al. 2019, Barkas et al. 
##  Marker Expression
Markers were selected from literature (Reva et al. 2025 bioRxiv, Zeisel et al. 2015 Science, Zeisel et al 2018 Cell, Hochgerner et al 2018 Nat Neurosci, Yao et al 2023 Nature, Yao et al 2021 Cell or La Manno et al 2021 Nature, Ding et al 2020 Cell Rep, Rosenberg et al. 2018 Science, Marques et al 2016 Science) or identified from within the dataset and verified on in situ hybridizaion experiments from Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (Lein et al. 2007 Nature, https://mouse.brain-map.org/) or Allen Developing Mouse Brain Atlas (https://developingmouse.brain-map.org/).
